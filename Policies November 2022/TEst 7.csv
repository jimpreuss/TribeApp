4  Challenge 3 - Social Equality   Vision   No one should be left behind. Everyone should be guaranteed equal rights and opportunities, and human rights need to be respected, applied, and upheld.  It is unacceptable that in 2018 people are still subject to discrimination because of their gender, sexuality, appearance, origin, or beliefs. It is equally intolerable that almost one in every four Europeans1 faces poverty or social exclusion, and that support is not provided for those who are most vulnerable. Finally, some Europeans still cannot make choices when it comes to their own bodies.   Volt is tackling social equality challenges by addressing four core issues and taking a holistic approach with the aim to end all forms of discrimination, stigmas and disparities, and ensuring that no one is left behind.   Volt strives to end discrimination against women and LGBTIQ+ people as well as discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity, nationality, descent, skin colour and belief. These issues will be addressed in four sectors: the law, the public sector, the workplace and the education system.  Volt works towards alleviating poverty by way of empowering individuals to become active members of society; combating homelessness, reducing youth poverty, reforming the social benefits and healthcare systems and introducing new forms of social and community housing.   Volt recognises that inclusion in society is fundamental and as such special focus is placed on seniors, people with special educational needs and disabilities as well as children in care.   Volt emphasises a person's right to their own body and their freedom to choose. Our policies therefore discuss reproductive rights, surrogacy, prostitution and ending life with dignity.     I.

5 “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.”2 Let’s make Europe equal by 2025!   A. End discrimination against women   Gender equality is a fundamental human right, and one that should be rapidly achieved. In the current state of our societies, women are still treated unfairly, face more barriers than their male counterparts, are subject to specific types of violence, and are discriminated against in their private, public and professional lives. An example of this is the fact that women are heavily discriminated against in the workplace: they tend to have lower salaries, are underrepresented in senior management positions, and experience workplace bullying and harassment. Another example is that menstruating persons are restricted in their ability to participate in society and are structurally disadvantaged due to their periods : period poverty is a global problem.   1. In the law  ➢ Promote legislation and concrete action to address persistent discrimination against women.   ➢ Work towards ending violence against women in a comprehensive manner, including through the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating both violence against women and domestic violence (the “Istanbul Convention”).3 4 2. In the public sector   ➢ Ensure that countries lead by example and apply inclusive and equal policies that actively contribute towards effective and sustainable gender equality. Comprehensive strategies are needed to address the issues, with a broad range of measures, such as trainings and overcoming stereotypes. Women not only continue to be underrepresented in decision-making positions at all levels, but the rate of progression in this regard is slow.5   ○ Implement comprehensive programmes to encourage women to get into politics and support them once there, through training courses, mentoring, public campaigns, and other means.   2 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 1, available at: https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights 3 For the full list, see Council of Europe, Chart of signatures and ratifications of Treaty 210, available at https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/210/signatures    5 European Commission, 2017 Report on equality between women and men in the EU, available at https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/2017_report_equality_women_men_in_the_eu_en.pdf    ",39357911,page

6 ○ Educate the public about the benefits of gender parity in political decision making.6  ➢ Require political parties to ensure equal representation of men and women on their lists of candidates for elections.7 The European Commission itself has explained that “formal quotas are an effective way to accelerate the pace of progress and encourage political parties to seek the participation of women.”8  ➢ Ensure gender parity9 within the public sector through various means, such as setting quotas or giving preference to female candidates during the recruitment process.10 Such measures will be in place as long as necessary, up until the desired outcome has been achieved.       ➢ Make reporting on gender representation mandatory at all levels of government, whether at the national, local, and regional level. This will draw attention to the lack of female representation. Public reporting can also prompt change due to possible reputational risks.  3. In the workplace   ➢ Require all mid-sized to large companies to disclose and report on gender balance and gender pay gap. Across the EU, wage gaps between genders is still at 16.0%.11 Greater transparency on gender pay gaps will help to tackle gender  6 EIGE, Gender equality in Political Decision-making, available at http://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/2016.1523_mh0116064enn_pdfweb_20170511095720.pdf  7 France introduced a compulsory 50% gender parity provision. Political parties are required to ensure the equal representation of men and women on their lists of candidates for most elections. The first major impact of the quota was in 2007, when the number of women in parliament rose to 18.5 percent (after the elections in 2017 it further grew up to 40%). See International IDEA, Gender quotas database France, available at https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/gender-quotas/country-view/86/35. This is the case in other European Countries, whether through a strict 50% rule like in France, or looser regulations. See International IDEA, Gender quotas database, available at https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/gender-quotas/database; Similar provisions already exist Germany, where most political parties introduced measures in their respective nomination procedures of candidates to increase the proportion of women in electoral lists. In particular gender quotas and zipping systems have proven positive effects. See Directorate-General for Internal Policies, Citizens’ rights and constitutional affairs, available at http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2015/510025/IPOL_IDA(2015)510025_EN.pdf .  8 European Commission, 2017 Report on equality between women and men in the EU, available at     https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/2017_report_equality_women_men_in_the_eu_en.pdf       9 The process to achieve, and the exact definition of, gender parity can vary depending on circumstances, and requires constant monitoring to measure progress made towards the goal. 10 Following the example of Germany, see Global Government Forum, Women Leaders Index Gender Equality Case Study.

10 5. Combating period poverty  Menstrual hygiene is not a choice or a luxury, but a necessity that should be treated accordingly in the context of society, charity and taxation. Volt is committed to combating period poverty and achieving greater equal opportunities through access to free menstrual products. Therefore, this policy focuses on enabling access to free menstrual products such as tampons and pads in public buildings.  ➢ Governments and local administrations ensure the distribution of free menstrual products to schools and other educational institutions, prisons, hospitals, food banks, homeless shelters, women's shelters and similar facilities, as well as to public toilets. The primary aim should be to ensure free access to sanitary pads.   ➢ Handling in public spaces: Depending on local conditions, either hygiene items are provided in all rooms or easy and generally, access is made possible. For example, in a common, protected anteroom for all genders. It is important here that “all rooms” also include male toilets and disabled-friendly toilets.  ➢ Proper education and awareness-raising on healthy menstrual hygiene and the removal of taboos are an important part of the fight against period poverty. Everyone should have access to knowledge to develop an understanding of how to deal with periods. Also Volt is committed to educate menstruating persons by schools and doctors about possible alternatives to hygienic pads and tampons.  This shall provide an opportunity for use of environmentally-friendly and healthy hygiene products.  ➢ Volt supports and promotes initiatives such as the EU Ecolabel for hygiene products to increase the production and consumption of hygiene products with a lower environmental impact. Every menstruating person should be entitled to a free menstrual cup from a gynaecologist every three years.  B. End discrimination against LGBTIQ+  people  Volt is based on the principles of equality for all, equal opportunities, and the respect of human rights. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ+) individuals are subject to discriminatory practices, violence, harassment, and so much more in every realm of their lives. LGBTIQ+ individuals each face different challenges and have different needs; there is no one-size-fits-all policy. Volt aims to introduce regulations and concrete actions to achieve equality in law and in practice for all. By this, we don’t mean an abstract concept of equality, but pure equality: we will settle for nothing less. We want to ensure that LGBTIQ+ people have access to the same rights and protections as others. It is also key to eliminate all forms of discrimination, whether ",39357911,page

Unfortunately, in many countries in Europe some people cannot yet get married because of the gender of the person they love.23 The fact that other types of partnerships exist and are available does not mean that this is acceptable in any way. This is why Volt will work to legalize marriage for all across Europe where it is not already the case, in order for heterosexual and homosexual couples to have access to the exact same rights, procedures, and union in the eyes of the state.24  ➢ Legalize adoption for same-sex couples. So many children need families, and so many families - or individuals - want children. The only criteria that should matter is whether one can and will provide a safe and loving environment to a child. Equality means that all should have the same rights, including the right to adopt a child. No, same-sex parents are not less able to raise a child than heterosexual ones. No, a child does not need both a maternal and a paternal figure. Otherwise, how could we explain that so many children raised by single parents or by homosexual parents are like everybody else? Otherwise, how could we justify letting single parents raise children alone? For these reasons, Volt will work to:   ○ give the opportunity to adopt a child to every adult - regardless of their gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status - based on the same criteria as those imposed for adoption on heterosexual couples according to local law.  ○ ensure that the procedure will be the same as for heterosexual couples. Homosexual couples and single parents should not have to jump through any additional hoops to be able to adopt. No discrimination should take place on the basis of a parent’s gender identity, sexual orientation, or marital status.  ➢ Guarantee transgender rights: ○ Make gender affirming procedures, such as hormone treatment, surgery and psychological support, accessible for transgender persons, and ensure that they are reimbursed by public health insurance schemes.25  ○ Challenge legislation that require transgender individuals to do the following to change their gender legally: undergo medical procedures  23 Marriage for same-sex couple is legal in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Malta, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. 24  It is necessary to stress that this is not an affront to religion: Volt stands for secular states; as a result is talking about civil rights and union in front of the state, and not religious ones.   25 See for example NHS, Gender Dysphoria, available at  https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gender-dysphoria/treatment/#surgery ",39357911,page

13 is essential to increase their visibility and revise laws where necessary.   Ensure that adequate deterrents, such as fines and criminal penalties, are in place and applied when acts of violence (hate crimes) or discrimination take place because of a person’s orientation, sexuality, and/or gender. 32   ➢ Conduct trainings for the police on hate crimes against LGBTIQ+ people.33  2. In the public sector   ➢ Ensure that countries lead by example and apply inclusive and equal policies  to actively contribute towards real equality. Comprehensive strategies are needed to address the issues, with a broad range of measures that could be used to accomplish this goal. ○ Implement comprehensive programmes to encourage minorities to get into politics, and support them once there, through training courses, mentoring, public campaigns,  and other means. ○ Educate the public about the benefits of diversity in political decision making.   ➢ Train judges, magistrates and other civil servants to recognize and address implicit biases towards minorities. The justice system is vital to ensuring that disputes are resolved in an orderly manner and that victims are protected. Volt wants to reinstate the confidence in the justice system and ensure that biases towards minorities are maintained at a minimum, if not eliminated, through trainings and other methods.    3.

17 ➢ Remove the terms ‘race’, ‘racism’ and ‘racial discrimination’  in all legislations. The current concept of different races is socially constructed, as scientifically there is only one human race (Homo sapiens).45 The use of such terms should therefore be eliminated in law and the concept should be redefined. On this merit, policies against discrimination shall consist of the following terms: ethnicity, national origin, descent or skin colour. N.B. Volt does not dispute the fact that “racism” - in the traditional meaning of the word  - exists and needs to end, but believes that acknowledging that all humans are of one race is a key factor in ending discrimination.     2. In the public sector   ➢ Ensure that countries lead by example and apply inclusive and equal policies  to actively contribute towards real equality. Comprehensive strategies are needed to address the issues with a broad range of measures, such as: ○ Implementing comprehensive programmes to encourage minorities to get into politics, and support them once there, through training courses, mentoring, public campaigns,  and other means. ○ Educating the public about the benefits of diversity in political decision making.   ➢ Train judges, magistrates and other civil servants to recognize and address implicit biases towards minorities. The justice system is vital to ensuring that disputes are resolved in an orderly manner and that victims are protected. Across Europe, people who are, or seem to be, from minority groups linked to their ethnicity or skin colour are still more likely to face arrest, charging, prosecution or imprisonment.46 It is therefore essential for judges, magistrates and other civil servants to demonstrate fairness and justness when carrying out their responsibilities.  Volt wants to reinstate confidence in the justice system and ensure that biases towards minorities are maintained at a minimum, if not eliminated, through trainings and other methods.  3.

For this, eliminate administrative hurdles (such as  requiring children to live in the neighborhood of the school in order to be able to register there). ○ Ensure that Roma people have access to basic infrastructure and human needs such as running water, electricity and heating.  ○ Incentivise programmes at the local level to help tackle issues Roma people most commonly face, including language classes, courses and trainings to help find employment, assistance in getting the right information on entitlements and access to healthcare, etc.    D. End discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief  Every individual has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as far as it does not restrict or violate the rights and freedoms of others. Religious discrimination is an unjustified act against an individual on the basis of their religion or belief. Such an act can be a direct form of violence or harassment, or indirect, where policies and practices place certain populations at a disadvantage. Despite a diverse European society, discrimination on these grounds still persists. For example, two in every five European Muslims experience discrimination in their workplace, housing and when accessing social services. One third claim verbal abuse.52 Volt believes that religion is a free choice and should be respected by others.

Social benefits are essential and should be designed to help the most vulnerable; however, they do not represent a long-term solution for alleviating poverty.  Therefore, the main focus of Volt’s policy consists of equipping everyone with the tools they need in order to have access to equal opportunities and fully participate in society.q  1. Social benefits and healthcare  ➢ Ensure that social benefits guarantee a basic standard of life (taking into account housing, food, clothing, healthcare, professional programmes, etc. in a given region) and cover a broad set of measures. Use social benefits as a transitory measure aiming to support people to get back on their feet and provide for themselves.   ➢ Introduce a monthly child benefits scheme and send young parents a welcome box for their newborn child. In Finland, such a measure contributed to one of the lowest infant mortality rates in history (e.g., new parents get send a starter kit of clothes, sheets and toys, and the box of the package can even be used as a crib). The maternity package is not to be commercially available, but available solely as a benefit offered.62  ➢ Ensure universal coverage and access to healthcare across Europe.63  2. In-work poverty  ➢ Guarantee a minimum income above absolute poverty levels. Volt envisions universal social protection and an adequate income to become core pillars of EU policy making.64 In-work poverty continues to be a burden for many workers throughout Europe. In 2016, 9.6% of EU citizens 18 and older who are currently employed faced in-work at risk of poverty.65 In other words, people are not remunerated sufficiently for their work, which represents a deeply unfair situation.   ➢ Venture into unconditional income: support large-scale experiments with unconditional basic income (UBI), to provide a solid knowledge basis to decide on the merits of this novel approach to social protection.    62  Finnish maternity boxes have been available since the 1930s, and provide an equal start in life for all babies.

25 B. Social and Community Housing   In the last few years, house prices have been growing faster than income in most Member States, with inequality and housing exclusion being mutually reinforcing.66 In addition to that, the presence of online booking portals (such as Airbnb) in major cities has affected accommodation availability and provoked a rise in rental prices.67  At the same time, economic inequality has been growing in European societies and large share of the population experiences periods of unemployment.68 Moreover, the flexibilisation of the job market has led to a diffuse decrease of security and social protection of workers in atypical forms of employment, with important repercussions on access to mortgage, rental contract, and affordable housing prices.69 Hence, ensuring access to housing with affordable renting prices undoubtedly is an urgent priority, and Volt intends to tirelessly work to realize it.   Volt believes that it’s crucial to acknowledge that the housing market is different from other markets. Land is distinguished from other forms of capital because of its unique characteristics: it is fixed in quantity and does not depreciate. In fact, as the population grows it tends to appreciate.70 It should therefore be the role of the government to make sure that citizens are protected and to endow public institutions with the task to ensure that housing policies are sufficiently elaborated, as access to a safe, secure, habitable and affordable housing is strictly interwoven with human dignity.  1. A living space for everyone   Volt wants to ensure that there are enough living spaces dedicated to social housing across Europe. Governments should guarantee that there are sufficient residential stocks dedicated to social housing, while promoting innovative forms of shared living and community-led housing. Housing policies should be tackled holistically as the right to a decent living is often entwined with other sensitive issues, such as those of the peripheries, the delicate coexistence and integration between migrants and local population, the re-urbanisation of areas at risk of abandonment and the environmental sustainability of buildings.  ➢ Ensure that there is sufficient social housing, and that allocation is equally spread throughout the urban areas.

Volt believes that digitalisation can provide an opportunity to enhance the accessibility of the allocation system to the recipients of the housing services, and can provide them with real-time information over the exact period of queuing, if any. This appears necessary in order to face the further urbanisation of European cities and the consequent difficulties in accessing affordable accommodations.85  ○ Volt intends to promote the adoption, by municipalities, of a digital platform system which grants the users (recipients of the housing policies) the possibility to choose among cheaper or rather more expensive solutions for public housing.86 The system is based on accumulated points in accordance to the waiting days.  ○ Volt encourages the adoption of a system that does not limit the choice to a single municipality,  in order to improve mobility.       84 For this purpose, the Danish housing law is identified as a best practice. Danish legislation allows price increases only once a year and regulates the maximum increase to that of the publicly available net retail price.

30 C. Homelessness   Homelessness levels have been on the rise across Europe in recent years.87 The EU’s 2020 Poverty Target88 and Social Investment Fund were supposed to tackle poverty and homelessness, but European governments, with the exception of Finland, have fallen behind in addressing the issue.89    Volt will work tirelessly to ensure that no one is left behind and to help those who are deemed the most vulnerable. Adequate social policies must be put in place to tackle homelessness and rough-sleeping in Europe. In an economically developed continent, there is no justification for people to live on the street, therefore every member of society must be given a chance to recover from hardship. Such a strategy is not only compassionate and fair, it is also a path to greater economic prosperity and social inclusion, through providing the means for homeless people to become active members of their communities. Homelessness needs to be tackled holistically; therefore, the following is not an exhaustive list, and other policies detailed throughout the document will all contribute towards its eradication, including, but not limited to: social benefits, accessible and appropriate health care, a decrease in unemployment, and reduced in-work poverty.     ➢ Invest in sustainable and affordable public housing to bring down the cost of rent, and allocate high-quality housing for those in need.90 Work with local governments to set targets for investment in social housing. Volt will push for a ‘housing first’ approach to ending homelessness, providing homeless people with social housing before other rehabilitation steps.91   ➢ Provide support for community-based social enterprise and rehabilitation initiatives. To do so, work with civil society organisations to expand initiatives focusing on preventing homelessness, as well as providing solutions to help those who are already on the street. Such initiatives can focus on various projects such as providing homeless people a home and an opportunity to work, and lifelong learning through vocational and entrepreneurial programmes,  87 Euronews, Homelessness on the Rise in all EU Countries - except Finland: Report, available at http://www.euronews.com/2018/03/21/homelessness-on-the-rise-in-all-eu-countries-except-finland-report  88 Eurostat - European 2020 indicators - poverty and social exclusion, available at http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Europe_2020_indicators_-_poverty_and_social_exclusion 89 FEANTSA, News: Housing First in Brno Meets Goal and is Set for Expansion, available at http://www.feantsa.org/en/news/2018/04/11/news-housing-first-in-brno-meets-goal-and-is-set-for-expansion  90 An example of this is HomeLab.

Participation   ➢ Ensure the accessibility of public transportation everywhere and support a barrier-free transport (e.g., barrier free underground/ metro services, regular transportation in rural areas, etc). People with SEND should be involved in planning decisions about local and accessible public transport, so that transport issues do not become a barrier to people’s participation.  ➢ Set minimum quotas across the private and public sector (mid-sized to large companies) to ensure that people with SEND are given the chance to work. If quotas are not met, companies should provide and contribute to vocational programmes to integrate people with disabilities.  Give benefits to companies that employ people with disabilities and tax breaks to companies focusing on technological innovation for those in need.  ➢ Promote the supported employment model, which is an individualised model to ensure people with SEND secure and retain employment. Using a collaborative strategy, the model allows people with SEND to sustain employment and businesses to employ valuable workers.126  ➢ Ensure that people with SEND are included in political decision-making processes.

40 it is particularly important if the parent/carer has SEND needs themselves.   6. Holistic approach   ➢ Provide guidance and funding to ensure provisions such as leisure centres, after school clubs and holiday play schemes can accommodate people with special educational needs and disabilities. This includes training staff, ensure buildings are accessible, and activities are differentiated.   ➢ Ensure co-ordination and co-operation among services (such as social care services, education, hospitals, transportation etc) to ensure a holistic approach and good communication between the key stakeholders.   C. Child in care   Every child deserves a home and an opportunity to live a happy life. Institutions, or orphanages, across Europe are proving to be insufficient to accommodate and address the needs of children who were placed under the care of the state.129   Deinstitutionalisation is a process of replacing institutional care for children with care in a family or family-like environment. The main focus should therefore be placed on supporting adoption policies and reforming the current institutional system. Poverty and social exclusion among families is a driving force of children's institutionalisation - many children placed in orphanages have parents - therefore our children's care policy goes hand in hand with our policy on the alleviation of poverty.  ➢ Give the opportunity to adopt a child to every adult - regardless of their gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status - based on the same criteria as those imposed on heterosexual couples, according to local law.   ➢ Enable children to have more than two legal parents if it is in the best interest of the child.130 Typical examples of this include a child raised by both their biological parents and by a third person who equally cares for the child, who could be a step-parent or a person who is also considered by the child to be a parent.   129 Opening Doors for Europe’s Children, Institutional Care in Europe, available at  http://www.openingdoors.eu/institutional-care-in-europe/  130 A  best practice example is California.

42 Volt believes that every person has the right to determine how to end their life with dignity, as long as no other person’s life is harmed. A wide range of support should be available and accessible for those people seeking help, in addition to medical attention, e.g. palliative medicine to alleviate pain, hospices to offer psychological or spiritual support, or flexible work-time to allow family members to care for dying relatives. In particularly grave situations of ""constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated,""135 a person may seek assistance to terminate their life, and deserves to be supported to do so with dignity.   We distinguish three forms of terminating life upon request:  - Passive Euthanasia: Passive euthanasia occurs when the person dies because the medical professionals either don't do something necessary to keep the person alive, or when they stop doing something that is keeping the person alive, such as switch off life-support machines, disconnect a feeding tube, don't carry out a life-extending operation, or don't give life-extending drugs.136 - Assisted Suicide: A person makes the request out of their free will, not coerced or pressured by other persons, and with full conviction, to take their life, and seeks professional (typically doctor’s) assistance.

44 C. Reproductive rights    The right to health includes women’s sexual and reproductive rights, which States have an obligation to respect, protect and guarantee. Women are entitled to reproductive health care services, goods, and facilities that are (a) available in adequate amounts; (b) accessible physically and economically; (c) accessible without discrimination; and (d) of good quality.139  Access to health services is a human right. However, women are often either denied this right or have limited access to it, especially when it comes to abortion or contraception.   1. Abortion   ➢ Make abortion accessible in the law and practice, and free for all women at least until the end of the first trimester.140   ○ Ensure that abortions are not only legal, but also accessible. This means that health centers and hospitals should offer the procedures across regions, and that there are no unreasonably long waiting lists. ○ Ensure that women have knowledge of, and access to, all possible types of abortion.  ➢ Make abortions accessible at a later stage as well, when a continued pregnancy would endanger the health of the mother or when the fetus is not viable.  ➢ Remove undue burdens on women such as  “cooling off periods”, parental consent, spousal or partner consent, multiple appointments necessitating multiple days off, etc. ○ For women under the age of 16, no parental consent is necessary, but an adult needs to be present.141    139 According to the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. See this UN report, available at https://www.who.int/medicines/areas/human_rights/A_HRC_7_11.pdf?ua=1 140  For example, in  Poland, abortion is only lawful to safeguard the life or health of a woman, in situations of severe fetal anomaly, or where the pregnancy results from rape or another criminal act such as incest; and even in those situations in which abortion is legal, multiple barriers combine to limit women’s access in practice. See Human Rights Watch, Polish Parliament Must Protect Women’s Health and Rights, available at https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/03/22/polish-parliament-must-protect-womens-health-and-rights.

D. Surrogacy143   Surrogacy is a method of assisted reproduction. There are two types of surrogacy arrangements: gestational surrogacy, where the embryo is created via in vitro fertilization (IVF) using the eggs and sperm of the intended parents or donors, and traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate mother uses her own egg and is artificially inseminated using sperm from the intended father or a donor. A surrogacy agreement can be altruistic or commercial. Surrogacy is already legal in some European countries,  142 The Council of Europe emphasised that sex education is one of the most critical issues in guaranteeing women's sexual and reproductive health. Nonetheless, even if some countries have established sex education in schools the information provided is not medically ""accurate, scientific and age-appropriate"" in a number of states or is focused on a ""preparation for family life"", according to the Council. In addition, in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Poland and Romania, sex education either remains voluntary or policies allow children to be withdrawn from classes.
